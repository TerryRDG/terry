However, the cheque 1780 is still not cleared and hence, appears in reconciliation statement. The checks 1782, 1783, 1784, 1785, 1787 are cleared and hence need no adjustment. The checks of 1780, 1786 and 1789 are not yet cleared and hence, should be added back to arrive at the bank statement balance.</p> <p>The returned check of NSF should be deducted.

The three possible reasons for the same could be:</p> <p>Checks issued by the company, but not yet presented by them – Company records the payment when check is issued. However, it appears in the statement when the same is presented in the Bank. The customers can present it within the deadline. Hence, the order differs based on when the customer presents the checks.</p> <p>Checks of previous months cleared in the present month – Checks issued in the previous months will be recorded in company’s books in the previous month. However, they appear in Bank statement when they are presented. They might be presented in the later months, which might result in missing of checks in order.</p> <p>Cancelled checks – Sometimes, checks may be cancelled after issuance by the company, due to incorrect amounts, names, etc. In such cases, the checks are not even presented to the bank. Those check numbers will not even be present, resulting in missing of checks in order.</p></div></div></div></div></section></li></ol></div></div></html>
